        <q>Take a good look. It's because of that great big pizza in the sky that people down there gotta struggle to survive.</q>

    <p class="text">Midgar is the capital city and power base of the Shinra Electric Power Company in the world of Gaia. It is a major location in Final Fantasy VII, Before Crisis -Final Fantasy VII-, Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII-, and Final Fantasy VII Remake, and also appears in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children and Dirge of Cerberus -Final Fantasy VII-.</p>

    <p class="text">Midgar opens Final Fantasy VII and is the location for the game's beginning. The city can be accessed again after the party has the Highwind by finding the key in Bone Village, but only the Sector 5 Slums and the Wall Market can be explored. Midgar is often seen only at night, especially the topside area. Gameplay in Final Fantasy VII, Before Crisis, and Crisis Core all keep the city in the dark while the player is above the plate. It is only when they are in the slums that sunlight can be seen trickling through the metal structure. Also, the Midgar area of the Final Fantasy VII world map is always in night time. One notable exception is the opening cinematic in Final Fantasy VII Remake, which begins with a daytime flyby of the city.</p>

        <q>Walled in on all sides, Midgar's biggest and most infamous entertainment quarter is run almost entirely by a man named Don Corneo. Free of Shinra's influence, this dangerous area of the city offers "intriguing" ways to pass the lonely nights.</q>

    <p class="text">Wall Market is an entertainment quarter and shopping center in the Sector 6 of Midgar Slums in Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VII Remake. It is famous for its dangerous "red light district" atmosphere run by the local crime lord, Don Corneo.</p>

    <p class="text">It is a vibrant shopping center in Sector 6, joined by the S7-6 road to Sector 6's Evergreen Park and its gate to the Sector 7 Slums, and joined to the Sector 5 Slums by the S5-6 Road. It is home to many stores inside buildings and tents set up around the market. Neon lights advertise the market's many attractions, including a diner, a gym, a bar named Drunkards, and the Honeybee Inn. Don Corneo's mansion is also located at the far end of the market.</p>

        <q>The Corneo Colosseum is located in the wild and dangerous Wall Market. The winner of a colosseum tournament receives not only glory and fame, but a substantial prize.</q>

    <p class="text">Corneo Colosseum is a battle arena in Final Fantasy VII Remake. It is part of the main quest in "The Town That Never Sleeps" and afterward the player can partake in matches there for various rewards, including the party's Level 2 limit breaks. The arena is located in the Wall Market along the way to Don Corneo's mansion, the proprietor of the colosseum who runs the entertainment district.</p>

    <p class="text">The first set of challenges, the Corneo Cup, are mandatory, and take place during the quest "Underground Colosseum" in "The Town That Never Sleeps". Later, separate challenges appear in the sidequests "Shears' Counterattack" or "A Dynamite Body", and during "In Search of Hope", the quest "Tomboy Bandit" leads to another separate challenge.</p>
