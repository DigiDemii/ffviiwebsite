        <q>A breed of flightless birds, characterized by their yellow feathers, distinct odor, and the unforgettable chirp, "kweh!" Domesticated for their gentle nature and quick feet, they are often used as a mode of ground transportation.</q>

    <p class="text">Chocobo [ˈtʃoʊ.kɵˌboʊ], also called Chocob, is a recurring animal in the series. Large avian creatures, chocobos roughly act as the Final Fantasy equivalent of horses, being domesticated for use as mounts, for pulling carts and carriages and for racing. Since their first appearance in Final Fantasy II, they have appeared in every game in the series in some capacity. As a mainstay they could be considered the series's mascot.</p>
